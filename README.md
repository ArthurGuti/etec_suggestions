# etec_suggestions
Etec Suggestion is a web software developed directly for the students of Etecs in Brazil, on this site students have the freedom to make criticisms and give totally anonymous suggestions. The Front End was developed in HTML, CSS, and JS. The Back End was developed in Java (it won't be working on the live server because I don't pay Hosters).
